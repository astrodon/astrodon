### 😎 Features

- Create webview windows with your own title and URL
- Bidirectional communication between your frontend and backend
- Compile your apps as executables and even make installers
- And most of what you get with Deno, e.g, TypeScript out of the box...

A lot is still missing, but we will get there!

### 🎁 Demo

~~**Note**: Latest public release only supports Windows and Linux, MacOS is not
supported. This will be fixed in the next release.~~

⚠️ **This will fail as Astrodon is currently unmaintained**

~~Run the demo:~~

```
deno run -A --unstable --reload https://deno.land/x/astrodon@0.1.0-alpha.2/examples/hello_world/demo.ts
```

### 📜 To-do

- [x] Unit tests
- [x] Cross-platform compiling (missing: Apple Silicon)
- [ ] Typescript checking in the background (astrodon-build's Develop should
      manage this)
- [x] Pass permission and arguments as flags and also put them in the executable
      metadata
- [x] Organize project a little bit better (e.g move dependencies to deps.ts)
- [x] A real-world app example
- [ ] Update the templates (wip)
- [x] Match `deno_runtime` version (and also things like `Deno.build`) with
      Deno's releases
- [ ] Implement Web Workers
- [ ] Schematize and create plugin system
- [ ] Organize configs by usage hierarchy (e.g. global.icon -> build.icon)
- [ ] Ability apps register custom system URI protocols (installer)
- [ ] Add Cli command `astrodon clean` to remove cached runtimes
- [x] Make Cli's command `astrodon run` also support HTTPs uris
  - [ ] Add support for common permission flags as CLI arguments

## 🤔 Plugins ideas

- [ ] Cross process reactivity module (plugin)
- [ ] Cross process store module (plugin)
- [ ] Env variable manager and injection for builds (plugin)

### 👩‍💻 Development

Requisites:

- Install the tauri dependencies as indicated in
  [Tauri's Guide](https://tauri.studio/v1/guides/getting-started/prerequisites).
- Rust (stable toolchain)
- Deno

Running both Deno and Rust tests:

```
deno task test
```
